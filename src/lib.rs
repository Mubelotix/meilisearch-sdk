//! MeiliSearch-sdk is an async client for [MeiliSearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/) written in Rust.
//! [MeiliSearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/) is a powerful, fast, open-source, easy to use and deploy search engine.
//! Both searching and indexing are highly customizable.
//! Features such as typo-tolerance, filters, and synonyms are provided out-of-the-box.

//! # üîß Installation
//!
//! This crate requires a MeiliSearch server to run. See [here](https://docs.meilisearch.com/guides/advanced_guides/installation.html#download-and-launch) to install and run MeiliSearch.
//!
//! Then, put `meilisearch-sdk = "0.1"` in your Cargo.toml, as usual.
//!
//! Since this crate is async, you have to run your program in the tokio runtime (cf the example below). You will need `tokio = { version = "0.2", features=["macros"] }` in your Cargo.toml. When targetting Wasm, the browser will replace tokio.
//!
//! Using this crate is possible without [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde), but a lot of features require serde.
//! Add `serde = {version="1.0", features=["derive"]}` in your Cargo.toml.
//!
//! # üöÄ Getting Started
//!
//! Here is a quickstart for a search request (please follow the [installation](#-installation) steps before)
//!
//! ```rust
//! use meilisearch_sdk::{document::*, indexes::*, client::*, search::*};
//! use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
//!
//! #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
//! struct Book {
//!     book_id: usize,
//!     title: String,
//! }
//!
//! // That trait is required to make a struct usable by an index
//! impl Document for Book {
//!     type UIDType = usize;
//!
//!     fn get_uid(&self) -> &Self::UIDType {
//!         &self.book_id
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     // Create a client (without sending any request so that can't fail)
//!     let client = Client::new("http://localhost:7700", "masterKey");
//!
//!     // Get the index called "books"
//!     let mut books = client.get_or_create("books").await.unwrap();
//!
//!     // Add some books in the index
//!     books.add_documents(&[
//!         Book{book_id: 123,  title: String::from("Pride and Prejudice")},
//!         Book{book_id: 456,  title: String::from("Le Petit Prince")},
//!         Book{book_id: 1,    title: String::from("Alice In Wonderland")},
//!         Book{book_id: 1344, title: String::from("The Hobbit")},
//!         Book{book_id: 4,    title: String::from("Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince")},
//!         Book{book_id: 42,   title: String::from("The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy")},
//!     ], Some("book_id")).await.unwrap();
//!
//!     // Query books (note that there is a typo)
//!     let query = Query::new("harry pottre");
//!     println!("{:?}", books.search::<Book>(&query).await.unwrap().hits);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Output:
//!
//! ```text
//! [Book { book_id: 4, title: "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" }]
//! ```
//!
//! # üåê Running in the browser with WASM
//!
//! This crate fully supports WASM. The only difference between the WASM and the native version is that the native version has one more variant (Error::Http) in the Error enum. That should not matter so much but we could add this variant in WASM too.
//! However, making a program intended to run in a web browser requires a **very** different design than a CLI program. To see an example of a simple Rust web app using meilisearch, see the [tutorial (not available yet)]().
//!
//! WARNING: `meilisearch-sdk` will panic if no Window is available (ex: Web extension).
//!
//! # ü§ñ Compatibility with MeiliSearch
//!
//! This crate is currently supporting MeiliSearch v11.0 and will be maintained.
//!
//! # Running the tests
//!
//! All the tests are documentation tests.
//! Since they are all making operations on the MeiliSearch server, running all the tests simultaneously would cause panics.
//! To run the tests one by one, run `cargo test -- --test-threads=1`.
